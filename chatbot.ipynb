        "Design a chatbot which can be used by any D2C ecommerce company to answer first level most common queries of their customers. If chatbot is unable to support it will then only pass the customer to manual customer support. This will help in reducing the no of support agents required to answer user questions plus customers will get a quicker response without having to wait for replies for basic questions.\n",
